# Week 10 ‚Äì STL (Standard Template Library) Examples

This folder contains a series of C++ examples that demonstrate the usage of various Standard Template Library (STL) containers, algorithms, and utilities. These examples are useful for understanding how built-in data structures and STL features can simplify common programming tasks.

## üìÅ Contents

| Example | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Example 12.1** | Demonstrates use of `vector` and `random_shuffle` to randomly order elements. |
| **Example 12.2** | Uses `list` to insert elements and retrieve them using `pop_front()`. |
| **Example 12.3** | Uses `deque` and `random_shuffle` for shuffling and retrieving elements. |
| **Example 12.4** | Implements a `stack` using `list` as the underlying container. |
| **Example 12.5** | Demonstrates bit manipulation using `bitset`. |
| **Example 12.6** | Uses `vector` and `find()` algorithm to search for an element. |
| **Example 12.7** | Shows set union operation using `set_union()` algorithm. |
| **Example 12.8** | Uses `fill()` and `fill_n()` to initialize arrays with values. |
| **Example 12.9** | Demonstrates `accumulate()` to compute sum and product of array elements. |
| **Example 12.10** | Custom class with STL `vector`, `sort()`, and `random_shuffle()` for string handling. |
| **Example 12.11** | Uses `map` to count the frequency of words from standard input. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- C++
- STL containers: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `stack`, `bitset`, `map`
- STL algorithms: `random_shuffle`, `find`, `set_union`, `fill`, `accumulate`, `sort`
- Custom class with operator overloading

## üí° How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, MSVC).
2. Uncomment the example you'd like to run.
3. Compile and execute it.

## üìå Note

Some examples use `<conio.h>` and `getch()` for pausing output, which are platform-specific and mainly work on Windows. You may remove or replace them with `cin.get()` for portability.
