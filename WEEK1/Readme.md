2. **Example 1.2** - Complex Number Class with Operator Overloading
3. **Example 1.3** - Template Function for Finding Maximum
4. **Example 1.4** - Template Class for Pair with Max/Min Functions
5. **Example 1.5** - Template Class with Array Size as a Parameter
6. **Example 1.6** - File I/O Example (Character Count)
7. **Example 1.7** - Student Grade Calculation with File I/O
8. **Exercise 1.1** - Complex Number Multiplication with Overloaded Operators
9. **Exercise 1.2** - Pair Class Template with Max/Min
10. **Exercise 1.3** - Template Class with Array Operations (Max, Min)
11. **Exercise 1.4** - Text File Processing and Character, Word, Sentence Count
12. **Exercise 1.5** - Real Estate Listings Management with User Input and Display
13. **Exercise 1.6** - Student Grades Processing with File I/O and Class Statistics

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code files in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Ensure that your system has a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
4. Compile and run the code by using the following command in the terminal (adjust for your system/compiler):
   ```bash
   g++ -o main main.cpp
   ./main
   ```

## File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Main code files with examples and exercises.
- `input.dat`: Sample input file for grade calculations (used in examples).
- `fout.txt`: Output file for storing results in some examples (auto-generated).
- `fin.txt`: Another input file for testing the program (used in exercises).

## Examples Overview

1. **Max Function Variants**: This example demonstrates how to find the maximum of two numbers using different methods (return, pass by reference, pass by pointer).
2. **Complex Class with Operator Overloading**: A class that represents complex numbers and overloads operators for addition and assignment.
3. **Template Functions and Classes**: These examples cover template functions and classes with type parameters, including finding the maximum of two values and working with pairs.
4. **File I/O**: Examples that show how to read and write data to files, including character counts and grade calculations.
5. **Exercises**: Additional exercises that apply the concepts in various practical scenarios, like manipulating complex numbers, managing real estate listings, and processing student grades.
